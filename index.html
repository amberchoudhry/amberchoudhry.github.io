        <img id="work1" class="pic" src="shinestars.png" width=45%>
        <div class="caption" id="c1">
            <p>This is a design I created for the front of a greeting card that would be given to someone on their graduation from school. I kept the design of the white top layer simple so that the complexity of the starry sky from behind can really pop.</p>
        </div>
        <img id="work2" class="pic" src="dreamcity.png" width=45%>
        <div class="caption" id="c2">
            <p>This design would be an advertisement for a real estate agency. The rounded corners and bright yellow color of the frame matches the pin icon, keeping the colors consistent. The pin is offset from the center of the image, imitating the way a person might quickly drop a pin on a map application.</p>
        </div>
        <img id="work3" class="pic" src="dataeverywhere.png" width=45%>
        <div class="caption" id="c3">
            <p>This design would be an advertisement for a software company specializing in data analytics. I chose an organic background image to contrast with the pixelated words. The connected lines and dots follow the curves of the sculpture background, implying that the sculpture is the subject of analysis here.</p>
        </div>
        <img id="work4" class="pic" src="jerrysgrill.jpg" width=45%>
        <div class="caption" id="c4">
            <p>This would be a landing page for a restaurant named Jerry's. The cursive font and bold double-outline used in the logo makes it the focal point. To make the words easier to read, I darkened the background image a little as well.</p>
        </div>
        <img id="work5" class="pic" src="artistsdigest.jpg" width=45%>
        <div class="caption" id="c5">
            <p>This would be the front page of a website centered around art-related news. I stuck with a simple white background to make the text and images stand out more, since news sites can look too busy sometimes with too many pictures. I chose a light sans-serif font for the news captions, and a bolder font for the news headlines to make them stand out.</p>
        </div>
        <img id="work6" class="pic" src="luthier.png" width=45%>
        <div class="caption" id="c6">
            <p>This would be a landing page for a company that makes, repairs, and sells guitars. I chose a darker background to give the site a dramatic look. I used a light, cursive font to speak to the elegance of hand-made guitars, and a bold, capitalized font for the slogan "We Know Guitars" to drive the point home.</p>
        </div>
        <img id="work7" class="pic" src="grass.jpg" width=45%>
        <div class="caption" id="c7">
            <p>This would be an advertisement for a non-profit dedicated to cleaning up the environment. I chose a green background to represent grass. I bunched the dark green triangles together randomly to make them look like trees, and chose a handwritten font for the upbeat message, "the grass will grow taller someday".</p>
        </div>
        <img id="work8" class="pic" src="astronautdreams.jpg" width=45%>
        <div class="caption" id="c8">
            <p>This design would be for an inspirational wall poster. I used circles and rectangles to create a minimalistic icon of an astronaut looking at the earth. The purple-to-pink gradient background imitates the way the atmosphere gets darker at higher altitudes. I played with unique fonts for the slogan, and outlined it to separate it from everything else.</p>
        </div>
        <img id="work9" class="pic" src="stripes.jpg" width=45%>
        <div class="caption" id="c9">
            <p>This would be for an online clothing shop named "Stripes". The word "Stripes" has a worn-out appearance, much like distressed jeans, to match the casual aesthetic of the shop's clothes. I drew a light-green banner and used a light, handwritten-style font for the sale sign to give the site an airy, summer feel.</p>
        </div>
        <img id="work10" class="pic" src="carwraps.jpg" width=45%>
        <div class="caption" id="c10">
            <p>This would be a sign for a business that wraps cars. I used a rich purple to draw a luxury vehicle to appeal to people who want their cars to stand out of the crowd. The ruby-red background is faded around the edges to give it a velvety appearance, and "Wraps" is written in an edgy font to give the sign a bold appearance.</p>
        </div>
        <img id="work11" class="pic" src="thankyou.jpg" width=45%>
        <div class="caption" id="c11">
            <p>This would be a design greeting card to say, "thank you" to someone. The diamond pattern in the background are meant to resemble a repeating pattern one might find on wrapping paper. The seagreen rectangle goes across the middle, like a ribbon on a present, and highlights the words. The pink bowtie also adds to the gift-like appearance. </p>
        </div>
        <img id="work12" class="pic" src="hope.png" width=45%>
        <div class="caption" id="c12">
            <p>This is a design for an advertisement for a social services and counseling center. The background is a dark and dull gray, while the word "hope" appears through an image of raindrops on a window. The image behind the word itself is dark, but still has spots of light in it. Those spots of light are a metaphor for how the employees want to help people see bits of hope during a difficult times.</p>
